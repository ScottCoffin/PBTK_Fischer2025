# PBTK Model for PFAS in Mice ‚Äì Model v1.0

This repository contains the R code for a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model developed to simulate the absorption, distribution, and elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in mice. The model integrates in vitro-derived parameters (e.g., permeability, protein/phospholipid binding, and transporter activity) with physiological data to simulate PFAS toxicokinetics.

New versions of the model will be added in the future. The mouse model is currently being adjusted for humans.

This version includes:
- A **standard PBTK model** for single simulation runs
- A **Monte Carlo (MC) version** to evaluate variability and calculate 95% confidence intervals
- A **sensitivity analysis version** to assess the sensitivity of TK parameters to outcomes (split into transporter-related and binding-related sensitivity)

## üìÅ File Overview

Models are provided for each PFAS chemical, which include the parameters (permeabilitiy, partition coefficients, membrane transporter interactions) specific to the chemical. The physiological parameters are the same for all models and can be found in the Supporting Information of Fischer et al. (2025).

Each model simulates toxicokinetics of the chemical in wild-type mice. The dosing regimen can be adjusted to single or repeated IV or oral dosing (see Fischer et al. 2025 for more information).
